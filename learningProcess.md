### Question
**3.What are active and diffused modes of thinking?**

### Answer
1. Active Thinking: This mode involves focused, concentrated, and analytical thinking. It's the state of mind where you are actively engaged in a task, concentrating on a specific problem or subject. Active thinking is often associated with logical reasoning and deep concentration. When you're in the active thinking mode, you're consciously working on a problem, following step-by-step instructions, and applying structured thinking to arrive at solutions.

2. Diffused Thinking: Diffused thinking is a more relaxed, background mode of thinking. It occurs when you're not consciously concentrating on a problem. Instead, your mind is allowed to wander, make connections, and form creative insights. This mode is associated with a more holistic, big-picture approach to thinking. It's especially useful for making connections between seemingly unrelated concepts and for fostering creativity and insight.
