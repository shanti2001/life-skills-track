### Question 1
In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?

### Answer
Commit to reading just one page of the book each day. This is an extremely manageable task that can be accomplished in a minute or two. 
Over time, you may find yourself reading more than just one page.
### Question 2: 
How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier? What are M, A and P.

### Answer
In BJ Fogg's Tiny Habits framework, "B = MAP" stands for Behavior equals Motivation, Ability, and Prompt.

**M** (Motivation): This refers to the desire or motivation to perform a certain behavior. To make a habit easier, you can boost motivation 
by connecting the new habit with something you already enjoy or are motivated to do.

**A** (Ability): Ability refers to how easy or difficult it is to perform a behavior. To make a habit easier, you can reduce 
the difficulty or friction associated with the behavior.

**P** (Prompt): A prompt is a cue or trigger that initiates the behavior. To make a habit easier, you can make the cue more obvious 
or prominent in your environment.

### Question 3: 
Why it is important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of habit? (This is the most important concept in today's topic. Whatever you celebrate becomes a habit)

### Answer 
 Celebrating after each successful completion of a habit is important because it helps reinforce the habit loop. When you associate a 
 positive and satisfying feeling with the completion of a habit, it strengthens the neural pathways associated with that habit. 
 This reinforces the behavior and makes it more likely to become a long-term habit. Celebrating, even in small ways, creates a sense of
  accomplishment and satisfaction, making the habit more attractive and easier to maintain.

### Question 5: 
What is the book's perspective about Identity?

### Answer 
In James Clear's book "Atomic Habits," the perspective on identity is central. Clear suggests that if you want to make lasting 
changes to your habits, you should focus on changing your identity. Instead of just trying to do something new 
you should focus on becoming the type of person who naturally exercises .

### Question 6: 
Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit easier to do?
### Answer 
To make a habit easier to do, "Atomic Habits" suggests you should focus on making the habit obvious, attractive, and easy. 
 This involves strategies like setting clear cues (making it obvious), finding ways to make the habit enjoyable (making it attractive), 
 and reducing the friction or effort required to perform the habit (making it easy).

### Question 7: 
Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit harder to do?
### Answer 
To make a habit harder to do, Clear suggests making it invisible, unattractive, and difficult. For example, 
you can hide or remove cues for a bad habit (making it invisible), associate negative consequences with the habit (making it unattractive), 
and increase the effort or obstacles required to perform the habit (making it difficult).


### Question 8: 
Pick one habit that you would like to do more of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue obvious or the habit more 
attractive or easy and or response satisfying?
### Answer 
Please specify the habit you'd like to do more of, and I can provide steps to make the cue obvious, 
the habit more attractive, or easier.

### Question 9: 
Pick one habit that you would like to eliminate or do less of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue invisible or 
the process unattractive or hard or the response unsatisfying?
### Answer 
Please specify the habit you'd like to eliminate or do less of, and I can provide steps to make the cue invisible, 
the process unattractive, or harder, or the response unsatisfying.
